= Gallery Layouts =

**Grid Layout**
The grid layout arranges images in uniform rows and columns with matching sizes. When your gallery has more images than grid cells, the remaining photos cycle through the grid with animation effects. For example, a 5x4 grid with 50 images will display 20 at a time while the other 30 rotate in randomly.

**Masonry Layout**
Masonry positions images in a Pinterest-style vertical arrangement. Images flow naturally without fixed row heights, making efficient use of page space. This layout works well for photos with different aspect ratios.

= Social Feed Integration =

**Instagram Feed**
Connect your Instagram account and display your feed directly on any page. The gallery fetches your Instagram photos automatically and displays them in your chosen layout style.

**Flickr Feed**
Pull your Flickr photos into the gallery using your API key and user ID. Display your Flickr albums in grid or masonry format with full lightbox support.

= Lightbox =

Every gallery includes a responsive lightbox that opens images in a larger popup view. The lightbox supports keyboard navigation, transition effects, and also plays YouTube and Vimeo videos. Navigation arrows let visitors browse through the entire gallery without closing the popup.

After creating your gallery, simply copy the shortcode and paste it into any page, post, or text widget. The gallery appears wherever you place the shortcode.
